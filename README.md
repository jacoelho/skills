# jacoelho

A Claude Code plugin with my personal skills and subagents. This repository is both the plugin and its marketplace.

| Skills | Agents |
| --- | --- |
| app-screen-design, architecture-review, programming-go-api-design, programming-go-performance, programming-simplicity, rest-api-design, spectacular-bdd-gherkin, spectacular-spec-grilling, spectacular-spec-review, spectacular-spec-writing, technical-writing, testing, voice-bc | command-runner, critic, programming-go-api-design, programming-go-performance, qa |

Everything is namespaced by the plugin name: skills run as `/jacoelho:<skill>` and agents are `jacoelho:<agent>`.

## Install

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add jacoelho/skills
claude plugin install jacoelho@jacoelho --scope user
```

Or declare it in `~/.claude/settings.json`, and Claude Code installs it at startup:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "jacoelho": { "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "jacoelho/skills" } }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": { "jacoelho@jacoelho": true }
}
```

Update with `claude plugin update jacoelho@jacoelho`, or turn on auto-update for the marketplace in `/plugin`. The plugin has no `version` field, so every commit is a new version.

## Develop

To try uncommitted edits, start a session with `claude --plugin-dir /path/to/skills`. It loads the checkout in place, and `/reload-plugins` picks up further edits. Run `claude plugin validate .` before pushing.

A machine can also install from the local checkout instead of GitHub:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add /path/to/skills
claude plugin install jacoelho@jacoelho --scope user
```

That install is a copy in `~/.claude/plugins/cache`, versioned by the HEAD commit. After committing, refresh it with `claude plugin marketplace update jacoelho && claude plugin update jacoelho@jacoelho`.

## Authoring rules

- Agent `skills:` preloads must use the prefixed name (`jacoelho:testing`). A bare name loads a personal skill of the same name from `~/.claude/skills` instead.
- Refer to agents by their prefixed name (`jacoelho:qa`) in skills, agents and `CLAUDE.md`.
- In skill bodies, reference bundled files with relative links, `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` or `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`. These variables are not expanded in agent descriptions.
- Keep all referenced files inside the repository. The installed copy holds nothing else.

`CLAUDE.md`, rules, the status line and `settings.json` are not plugin components and are not stored here.
